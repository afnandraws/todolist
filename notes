Things outstanding:

- Edit existing tasks functionality
- 'Add Subtasks' functionality
- Clean up completion of tasks as well as displaying of completed tasks
- Fix colours for tags
- Remove socket.io integration
- Integrate IndexedDB API

- Got quite far in development but I realised that prop drilling was getting too heavy, I had the following levels: - TodoApp - Todos - Todo - Subtasks
  So I decided to use ReduxToolkit

- All that's left is:
  - Completed Tasks
  - IndexedDB implementation
